# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the notifyer-cron serverless application from AWS SDK for JavaScript v2 to v3. The AWS SDK v2 is entering maintenance mode on September 8, 2024, and will reach end-of-support on September 8, 2025. This migration ensures continued security updates, performance improvements, and access to new AWS services while maintaining full compatibility with the existing serverless framework architecture.

Based on AWS documentation, the v3 SDK offers significant benefits including reduced bundle sizes (from ~3.4MB to ~234KB for DynamoDB), improved cold start performance, modular architecture with tree-shaking support, and first-class TypeScript support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the notifyer-cron application, I want to migrate from AWS SDK v2 to v3, so that I can ensure continued security support and access to performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use AWS SDK v3 packages instead of v2
2. WHEN DynamoDB operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use the new modular DynamoDB client from AWS SDK v3
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work identically to the current implementation
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the bundle size SHALL be reduced from approximately 93.6MB (v2) to approximately 17MB (v3) for install size
5. WHEN Lambda functions execute THEN cold start performance SHALL be improved due to smaller bundle sizes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a serverless application, I want to maintain compatibility with the serverless framework and its plugins, so that deployment and local development workflows remain unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed using serverless framework THEN the deployment SHALL succeed without serverless.yml configuration changes
2. WHEN Lambda functions execute THEN they SHALL have the same IAM permissions and environment variables as before
3. WHEN the application runs in AWS Lambda THEN cold start times SHALL be improved or remain the same
4. WHEN webpack bundling occurs THEN the new SDK SHALL be properly bundled with tree-shaking optimizations
5. WHEN using serverless-webpack plugin THEN external dependencies SHALL be configured correctly for v3 modular imports
6. WHEN using serverless-offline for local development THEN all v3 SDK operations SHALL function correctly
7. WHEN using local development commands (npm run dev, npm run offline) THEN they SHALL work without modification
8. WHEN serverless plugins require updates THEN compatible versions SHALL be identified and upgraded

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system that persists data to DynamoDB, I want the database operations to work seamlessly after migration, so that no data is lost and all operations continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN getItem operations are called THEN the system SHALL retrieve data from DynamoDB using the v3 DynamoDBDocumentClient
2. WHEN setItem operations are called THEN the system SHALL store data to DynamoDB using the v3 DynamoDBDocumentClient
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them with the same error handling patterns as v2, accounting for v3's error structure changes
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing data in DynamoDB SHALL remain accessible and unchanged
5. WHEN undefined values are encountered THEN the system SHALL configure marshallOptions.removeUndefinedValues to maintain v2 behavior
6. WHEN using the Document Client THEN the system SHALL use @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb package with proper client instantiation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to include proper error handling and logging, so that debugging and monitoring capabilities are maintained or improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS SDK v3 operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors in a format consistent with existing logging
2. WHEN DynamoDB operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL handle them accounting for v3's error metadata structure changes (error.$metadata)
3. WHEN the application runs THEN console output SHALL clearly indicate successful v3 SDK usage
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN error messages SHALL provide sufficient context for troubleshooting
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle the new v3 error structure where metadata is in subfields rather than top-level

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the codebase, I want the migration to follow AWS SDK v3 best practices, so that the code is future-proof and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing AWS services THEN the system SHALL use modular imports (e.g., @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb, @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb) to enable tree-shaking
2. WHEN creating AWS clients THEN the system SHALL follow v3 patterns for client instantiation using DynamoDBClient and DynamoDBDocumentClient.from()
3. WHEN making AWS API calls THEN the system SHALL use the new command pattern from v3 (GetCommand, PutCommand, UpdateCommand)
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the package.json SHALL only include necessary v3 dependencies and remove v2 dependencies
5. WHEN configuring the DynamoDB client THEN the system SHALL use the recommended bare-bones client approach for optimal performance
6. WHEN handling AWS credentials THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing AWS credential configuration methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the migration to maintain compatibility with existing AWS infrastructure and monitoring, so that operational procedures remain unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN existing IAM roles and policies SHALL continue to work without modification
2. WHEN CloudWatch logging occurs THEN log formats and structures SHALL remain consistent with current implementation
3. WHEN AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled THEN tracing SHALL continue to work with v3 SDK operations
4. WHEN the application runs in Lambda THEN existing environment variables and configuration SHALL remain functional
5. WHEN monitoring tools access the application THEN existing observability patterns SHALL continue to function
