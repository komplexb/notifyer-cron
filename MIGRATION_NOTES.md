# Microsoft Graph SDK Migration

## Overview

This project has been successfully migrated from direct REST API calls using `superagent` to the official Microsoft Graph SDK (`@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client`) for OneNote operations.

## What Changed

### New Files Added

1. **`lib/graph-auth-provider.js`** - Authentication provider bridge that integrates existing MSAL tokens with the Graph SDK
2. **`lib/graph-client.js`** - Factory for creating properly configured Graph SDK clients
3. **`lib/graph-onenote-service.js`** - Service layer that encapsulates all OneNote operations using the Graph SDK
4. **`lib/__tests__/`** - Comprehensive test suite for the migration

### Files Updated

- **`lib/onenote.js`** - Completely rewritten to use the Graph SDK while maintaining identical function signatures
- **`package.json`** - Added `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` and `isomorphic-fetch` dependencies

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **100% Backward Compatible** - All existing function signatures work identically:

- `getNote(settings)` - Retrieves random or sequential notes
- `setNoteSection(settings)` - Finds and sets the OneNote section
- `getNoteCount(section, settings)` - Gets page count for a section
- `getNotePreview(note)` - Gets page preview with metadata
- `getNoteContents(url)` - Gets full HTML content of a page
- `extractFirstImage(htmlContent)` - Extracts image metadata from HTML
- `downloadImage(imageUrl, maxSizeBytes)` - Downloads images with size limits
- `getImageSize(imageUrl)` - Gets image size before downloading

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Official Support** - Using Microsoft's official SDK with ongoing support
2. **Better Error Handling** - Enhanced error messages and automatic retries
3. **Improved Authentication** - Seamless integration with existing MSAL tokens
4. **Type Safety** - Better IntelliSense and type checking (when using TypeScript)
5. **Future-Proof** - Access to new Graph API features as they're released

## Dependencies

### Added
- `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client@^3.0.7` - Official Microsoft Graph SDK
- `isomorphic-fetch@^3.0.0` - Fetch polyfill for Node.js

### Kept
- `superagent@^10.0.0` - Still used by `lib/notify.js` for Telegram API calls

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been added in `lib/__tests__/`:

- **Authentication Provider Tests** - Validates token handling and expiration
- **Graph Service Tests** - Tests all OneNote API operations
- **Integration Tests** - End-to-end validation of migration functionality

Run tests with: `npm test`

## Migration Architecture

```
Old: MSAL → superagent → Microsoft Graph API
New: MSAL → Graph SDK → Microsoft Graph API
```

The new architecture maintains the same MSAL authentication system while leveraging the Graph SDK's built-in features for API calls, error handling, and request optimization.

## Performance

- **Response Times** - Comparable to or better than previous implementation
- **Error Recovery** - Automatic retries for transient failures
- **Memory Usage** - Efficient streaming for large image downloads
- **Caching** - Existing localStorage patterns preserved

## Rollback Plan

The migration has been completed successfully. If issues arise, you can revert to the previous implementation by:

1. Restoring the original `superagent`-based code from version control
2. Removing the Graph SDK dependencies if desired
3. Updating the authentication flow to use direct REST API calls

## Future Considerations

- **Remove superagent** - Once `lib/notify.js` is migrated to use native fetch or Graph SDK
- **TypeScript** - Consider adding TypeScript definitions for enhanced development experience
- **Additional Graph APIs** - Easy to extend for other Microsoft Graph services (Outlook, Teams, etc.)
